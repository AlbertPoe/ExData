Exploraroy Data Analysis Assignment 1
The assignment was to write code that would load data into R and creat a series of plots.

I assume that the data file in already downloaded onto your machine and that you set the WD.

In general, my code loads the first row of the data set adn take the column names.
I then skip the necessary number of rows to get the the correct time/date. The download the 
correct number of line of data for the two days we are interested. 

Next the data and time variable are manipulated from factors to date and time adn formated 
correctly so the data will plot correctly. I then add the column names and create a series 
of plots.
